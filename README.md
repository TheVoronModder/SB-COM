I do not expect the Carriage to have a perfect COM, however, its interesting to see where we are at with the added mods eliminating heatserts from the face of the toolhead mount, instead utilizing 304ss square nuts.

## UPDATE, added CW2 Assembly, NOTE- The Motor is not right yet, I need to weight my LDO stepper motor before adding the weight...
